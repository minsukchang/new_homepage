                <p> In a nutshell, I've been thinking mostly about the two major bridges HCI systems research has to ML/AI research that
                  haven't been actively explored. (In no specific order) First is building computational interaction techniques 
                  that are powered by ML technologies. Researches in this area goes both ways, as in building novel interfaces 
                  and interactions using models from cognitive science and ML algorithms, AND understanding (or reverse engineering) 
                  computational user models from collected data. </p> 
              <p> This is also quite new to most people at CHI, as we just now have the 
                  computational interaction subcommittee (note the subcommittee isn't all about ML, b
                  ut I suspect that's where ML-like papers will get submitted to from now on) - 
                but I've seen this small community grow for 4 years, have been part of it, 
                and I'm very very excited that we finally made it to a vital part of HCI. 
              </p>


<p> Second one is data collection and evaluation of AI/ML systems. Data is so important in ML, 
  and we know as HCI researchers that the interactions and interfaces heavily influence user behaviors, 
  thus the data being collected. This is literally a double-edged sword, because this means a) the existing datasets 
  need re-examinations as they might not be true samples of how users behave (and one recurring example being thrown everywhere 
  is that systems trained on one of these data creating all sorts of problems like racial, gender discrimination, etc., 
  there are many other examples) b) we can deliberately implement interactions and interfaces to collect the type of data 
  we want and need - this can be very useful for building ML/AI systems.
              </p>
              <p>
Also, evaluation of ML systems (I use the term "systems" as a concept larger than algorithms) cannot be done without users, 
                and there are takeaways and insights that potentially influence the design of inner workings, namely the ML algorithms. 
                (This ties back to the computational interaction above, which I find rather neat.) 
                Distilling user insights into chunks of ideas that drive algorithm development is the most crucial part that hasn't been talked about at all. 
</p>

              <p>
I am very confident Naver has the perfect environment to excel in these two departments because we already possess state of the art
                ML research pipeline and technologies, have a good understanding of user problems and hci problems, and all we need 
                is more activity from the HCI side.
